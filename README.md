## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>📄 What types of documents can I use?</b></summary>

KnowledgeGPT supports PDF, Word documents (.docx), plain text files (.txt), and Markdown (.md) files.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔒 Is my data secure?</b></summary>

Yes! Your documents are processed locally on your machine. Only the necessary chunks are sent to the LLM API for generating responses, and no data is stored on external servers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 How accurate are the responses?</b></summary>

KnowledgeGPT uses advanced RAG techniques to retrieve the most relevant information from your documents. The accuracy depends on the quality of your documents and the specificity of your questions. The system always provides source references so you can verify the information.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔄 Can I use a different LLM?</b></summary>

Yes, the system is designed to be model-agnostic. You can modify the configuration to use other LLMs like GPT-4, Llama, or Mistral by adjusting the settings in the config file.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📊 How many documents can I upload?</b></summary>

There's no hard limit on the number of documents, but performance may decrease with very large document collections. For optimal performance, we recommend keeping your knowledge base under 1,000 pages total.
